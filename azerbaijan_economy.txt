   [107]Azerbaijan has an economy that has completed its
   post-Soviet transition into a major oil based economy (with the
   completion of the [108]Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline), from one
   where the state played the major role. The transition to oil
   production led to remarkable growth figures as projects came
   online; reaching 26.4% in 2005 (second highest [109]GDP growth
   in the world in 2005 only to [110]Equatorial Guinea) and 34.6%
   in 2006 (world highest) before subsiding to 10.8% and 9.3% in
   2008 and 2009 respectively.^[111][13] The real GDP growth rate
   for 2011 was expected at 3.7% but had dropped to
   0.1%.^[112][14] Large [113]oil reserves are a major contributor
   to the economy. The national currency, the [114]Azerbaijani
   manat, was stable in 2000, depreciating 3.8% against the
   dollar. The budget deficit equaled 1.3% of GDP in 2000.

   Progress on economic reform has generally lagged behind
   [115]macroeconomic stabilization. The government has undertaken
   regulatory reforms in some areas, including substantial opening
   of trade policy, but inefficient public administration in which
   commercial and regulatory interests are co-mingled limit the
   impact of these reforms.^[116][15] The government has largely
   completed [117]privatization of agricultural lands and small
   and medium-sized enterprises. In August 2000, the government
   launched a second-stage privatization program, in which many
   large state enterprises will be privatized. Since 2001, the
   economic activity in the country is regulated by the
   [118]Ministry of Economic Development of Azerbaijan Republic.

Economic history of Azerbaijan[[141]edit]

    [141] https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Economy_of_Azerbaijan&action=edit&section=1

Modern era[[142]edit]

    [142] https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Economy_of_Azerbaijan&action=edit&section=2

   Through the Soviet period, Azerbaijan had always been less
   developed industrially than Armenia and Georgia, two
   neighboring Transcaucasia countries - but also less
   diversified, as a result of slow investment in non-oil sector.
   With a history of industrial development of more than 100
   years, Azerbaijan proved to be a leading nation in Southern
   Caucasus throughout the turmoil of Soviet Union collapse in
   early 1990s until nowadays.

Republic era[[143]edit]

    [143] https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Economy_of_Azerbaijan&action=edit&section=3

   Oil remains the most prominent product of Azerbaijan's economy
   with cotton, natural gas and agriculture products contributing
   to its economic growth over the last five years. More than $60
   billion was invested into Azerbaijan's oil by major
   international oil companies in AIOC consortium operated by
   [144]BP. Oil production under the first of these PSAs, with the
   Azerbaijan International Operating Company, began in November
   1997 and now is about 500,000 b/d. People visit petroleum spas
   (or "oil spas") to bathe in the local crude in
   [145]Naftalan^[146][16] A leading [147]caviar producer and
   exporter in the past, Azerbaijan's [148]fishing industry today
   is concentrated on the dwindling stocks of [149]sturgeon and
   [150]beluga in the [151]Caspian Sea.

   Azerbaijan shares all the problems of the former Soviet
   republics in making the transition from a [152]command to a
   [153]market economy, but its energy resources brighten its
   long-term prospects. Azerbaijan has begun making progress on
   economic reform, and old economic ties and structures are
   slowly being replaced. An obstacle to economic progress,
   including stepped up foreign investment, is the continuing
   conflict with Armenia over the [154]Nagorno-Karabakh
   region.^[155][17]

   In 1992, Azerbaijan became member of the [156]Economic
   Cooperation Organization.^[157][18] In 2002, the Azerbaijani
   [158]merchant marine had 54 ships.^[159][19] In March 2001,
   Azerbaijan concluded a [160]gas agreement with Turkey,
   providing a future export market for Azerbaijan.

   Azerbaijan has concluded 21 production-sharing agreements with
   various oil companies. An export pipeline that transports
   Caspian oil to the Mediterranean from [161]Baku through
   [162]Tbilisi, [163]Georgia to [164]Ceyhan, [165]Turkey (the
   [166]Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline) became operational in 2006.
   The pipeline is expected to generate as much as $160 billion in
   revenues for the country over the next 30 years. The recent
   high price of oil is highly beneficial to Azerbaijan's economy
   as the nation is in the midst of an oil boom. Eastern Caspian
   producers in Kazakhstan also have expressed interest in
   accessing this pipeline to transport a portion of their
   production.

   In 2010, Azerbaijan entered into the top eight biggest oil
   suppliers to EU countries with €9.46 billion.^[167][20] In
   2011, the amount of foreign investments in Azerbaijan was $20
   billion, a 61% increase from 2010. According to [168]Minister
   of Economic Development of Azerbaijan, [169]Shahin Mustafayev,
   in 2011, "$15.7 billion was invested in the non-oil sector,
   while the rest - in the oil sector."^[170][21]

   In 2012, because of its economic performance after the Soviet
   breakup, Azerbaijan was predicted to become "[171]Tiger of
   Caucasus".^[172][22]^[173][23]^[174][24] In 2012,
   [175]Globalization and World Cities Research Network study
   ranked Baku as a Gamma-level [176]global city.^[177][25]

   In 2015, Turkey and Azerbaijan agreed to boost mutual trade to
   US$15 billion by 2023.^[178][26]

   For purchasing power parity comparisons, the US dollar was
   exchanged at 1,565.88 Manats only. Currently, the new Manat is
   in use, with an exchange rate of about 1 manat = $1.10. Mean

   For more than a century the backbone of the Azerbaijani economy
   has been [182]petroleum, which represented 50 percent of
   Azerbaijan's GDP in 2005, and is projected to double to almost
   125 percent of GDP in 2007.^[183][29] Now that Western oil
   companies are able to tap deepwater oilfields untouched by the
   [184]Soviets because of poor technology, Azerbaijan is
   considered one of the most important areas in the world for oil
   exploration and development. Proven [185]oil reserves in the
   [186]Caspian Basin, which Azerbaijan shares with [187]Russia,
   [188]Kazakhstan, [189]Iran, and [190]Turkmenistan, are
   comparable in size to the [191]North Sea, although exploration
   is still in the early stages.

   Azerbaijan has the largest agricultural basin in the region.
   About 54,9 percent of Azerbaijan is agricultural lands. At the
   beginning of 2007 there were 4,755,100 hectares of utilized
   agricultural area.^[195][30] In the same year the total wood
   resources counted 136 million m³.^[196][30] Azerbaijan's
   agricultural scientific research institutes are focused on
   meadows and pastures, horticulture and [197]subtropical crops,
   [198]leaf vegetables, [199]viticulture and [200]wine-making,
   cotton growing and [201]medicinal plants.^[202][31] In some
   lands it is profitable to grow grain, potatoes, [203]sugar
   beets, cotton and tobacco. Livestock, [204]dairy products, and
   wine and [205]spirits are also important farm products. The
   Caspian [206]fishing industry is concentrated on the dwindling
   stocks of [207]sturgeon and [208]beluga.

   The [222]GDP growth rates observed in Azerbaijan during last
   years made the country one of the fastest growing economies in
   the world. But the banking sector of Azerbaijan has yet to tap
   the vast growth potential that should be achievable due to the
   continuation of the high economic growth.^[223][40] For this
   reason the banking sector remains small in relation to the size
   of the Azerbaijani economy. Since 2002, important stages of
   [224]restructuring of the banking system have started to be
   carried out. Taking into consideration entry of big oil
   revenues in the country, as a logical result of successful oil
   strategy, and in this base, as the banks were ready to an
   effective transfer of their financial resources to the
   strategic goals, development strategy was made for 2002–2005.

   development of trust in bank system, improving the legal bases
   of protection of interests of creditors and depositors, in
   particular launch of ‘Deposits Insurance Fund’ were the
   criteria characterizing rapid growth of deposits of population.
   As of 1 April 2010, [225]bank deposits of population were equal
   to 2,4 billion AZN. 33,3% of them were long-term deposits
   (higher than a year). As of 1 April 2010, bank credits to
   customers is 8.5 bn AZN, which makes 70.5% of bank assets.

   Tourism is an important part of the economy of Azerbaijan. The
   country was a well-known tourist spot in the 1980s. However,
   the fall of the Soviet Union, and the [250]Nagorno-Karabakh War
   during the 1988-1994 period, damaged the tourist industry and
   the image of Azerbaijan as a tourist destination.^[251][46]

    [250] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_War
     [46] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_sector_of_the_economy

   It was not until the 2000s that the tourism industry began to
   recover, and the country has since experienced a high rate of
   growth in the number of tourist visits and overnight
   stays.^[252][47] In the recent years, Azerbaijan has also
   becoming a popular destination for religious, spa, and health
   care tourism.^[253][48] During winter, the [254]Shahdag Winter
   Complex offers skiing.

   The [255]government of Azerbaijan has set the development of
   Azerbaijan as an elite tourist destination a top
   priority.^[256][49] It is a national strategy to make tourism a
   major, if not the single largest, contributor to the

   The [263]Azerbaijani manat is the currency of Azerbaijani,
   denominated as the [264]manat, subdivided into 100 [265]qapik.
   The manat is issued by the [266]Central Bank of Azerbaijan, the
   monetary authority of Azerbaijan. The [267]ISO 4217
   abbreviation is AZN. The Latinised symbol is ([268] Azeri manat

   The manat is held in a floating [269]exchange-rate system
   managed primarily against the [270]US dollar. The [271]rate of
   exchange (Azerbaijani manat per US$1) for 28 January 2016, was

   There is a complex relationship between Azerbaijan's
   [272]balance of trade, inflation, measured by the [273]consumer
   price index and the value of its currency. Despite allowing the
   value of the manat to "float", Azerbaijan's [274]central bank
   has decisive ability to control its value with relationship to
   other currencies.

   pipeline (BTC) became operational in May 2006 and extends more
   than 1,774 kilometers through the territories of Azerbaijan,
   Georgia and Turkey. The BTC is designed to transport up to
   50 million tons of crude oil annually and carries oil from the
   Caspian Sea oilfields to global markets.^[308][56] The
   [309]South Caucasus Pipeline, also stretching through the
   territory of Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey, became operational
   at the end of 2006 and offers additional gas supplies to the
   European market from the [310]Shah Deniz gas field. Shah Deniz
   is expected to produce up to 296 billion cubic meters of
   natural gas per year.^[311][57] Azerbaijan also plays a major

   A "single authority principle" requires customs officials to be
   more responsible in dealing with all types of border control
   operations for other authorities. [342]The Netherlands and
   [343]Sweden were the countries of which practice
   studied.^[344][59] A "single system" works on and then shares
   standardized information accumulated from traders to all
   entities taking part in international trade. The practice of
   [345]US was explored in this phase.^[346][59] An "automated
   system" provides a single electronic statement to responsible
   agencies submitted by traders to be worked on and confirmed,
   and after that, these authorities send electronic confirmations
   and announcements. In this case, practice of [347]Mauritius and
   [348]Singapore was studied.^[349][59]

   Azerbaijani government supports financially single window
   system. In the first phase, the government realized customs
   clearance system on the process of border crossing to country
   beginning from January 1, 2009. This system was free to all
   users. Then it was expanded to Baku and Sumgayit in
   2011.^[358][59] Customs code of the Republic of Azerbaijan was
   amended based on the inclusion of the article on single window
   system which became operative on January 1, 2012. After this
   amendment, all of Azerbaijan's 29 customs checkpoints started
   to implement new single window system.

   According to the Presidential Decree (11 November 2008),
   “single window” principle started to be applied from 1 January
   2009 on the inspection of goods and transportation at the
   border checkpoints.^[359][64] Customs Committee established a
   commission working on the implementation of “single window”
   principle in customs agencies on 18 November 2008 based on the
   Presidential Decree of 11 November 2008.^[360][65]
   Technological scheme determining the sequence of issuance of
   “permit” certificates was approved by the Customs Committee on
   22 December 2009. Scheme provided customs officers to issue
   “permit” certificates at border checkpoints to vehicles, which
   perform customs, veterinary, photo-sanitary and sanitary
   quarantine control activities and international automobile
   transportation in accordance with legislation.^[361][66]

   The [362]State Migration Service issues appropriate permits for
   foreigners and stateless persons coming to Azerbaijan to live
   and work on legal grounds, simplifying the procedure of their
   registration at the place of residence, and ensuring
   transparency in these processes. The “single window” principle
   has been applied on migration management processes starting
   from 1 July 2009 according to the Decree.^[363][67]

Business environment[[364]edit]

    [364] https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Economy_of_Azerbaijan&action=edit&section=17

   As of October 2014, Azerbaijan holds the highest foreign
   investment per capita among the Commonwealth of Independent
   States (CIS) countries. Germany, for example, has invested
   approximately $760 million into the Azerbaijani economy, and
   approximately 177 German companies operate within Azerbaijan.
   Since gaining its independence, companies have invested $174
   billion into Azerbaijan. Foreign investment accounts for around
   half of that amount.^[365][68]

     [68] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey

   In 2008, Azerbaijan was cited as the top reformer by the
   [366]World Bank's [367]Doing Business report:^[368][69]

    [366] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank
    [367] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doing_Business_report

     Azerbaijan led the world as the top reformer in 2007/08,
     with improvements on seven out of 10 indicators of
     regulatory reform. Azerbaijan started operating a one-stop
     shop in January 2008 that halved the time, cost, and number
     of procedures to start a business. Business registrations
     increased by 40% in the first 6 months. Azerbaijan also
     eliminated the minimum loan cutoff of $1,100, more than
     doubling the number of borrowers covered at the credit
     registry. Also, taxpayers can now file and pay their taxes
     online. Azerbaijan’s extensive reforms moved it far up the
     ranks, from 97 to 33 in the overall ease of doing business.

   According to [369]World Bank's [370]Doing Business report 2019,
   [371]Azerbaijan improved its position in the Ease of doing
   business rank from 57 to 25, as well as ranked 4th among the
   top 10 improvers.^[372][70]^[373][71]^[374][72]^[375][73]
   Implementing a record number of reforms mainly involving
   institutional changes have made it easier to do business in
   Azerbaijan in 2017-2018 period, as a result time and cost to
   get construction permit reduced significantly (time by 80 days
   and cost by 12.563 [376]AZN), process of connecting electricity
   grid rationalized, as well as getting credit
   simplified.^[377][70]
